This directory contains source code for the parts of N-Angulator.  The
na.el file is (X)emacs Lisp source, and the corresponding *.elc file is the
byte-compiled versions.  Byte-compiled files are architecture-independent.

The na-members.sh is a Borne Again Shell file which must be relocated somewhere
within the user's path (e.g. /usr/local/bin).

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

See COPYING for license information.
